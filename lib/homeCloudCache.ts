// Crowdsourced home-feed cache (Supabase) — the LAST-RESORT fallback for the
// home screen.
//
// Why this exists: a small set of users can't reach ANY scrape source
// (witanime + anime4up + anime3rb) — typically an ISP-level block that DNS-over-
// HTTPS can't beat (IP/SNI filtering). Their devices can still reach Supabase
// (their remote logs arrive), so the working majority acts as scouts: every
// device that successfully scrapes a home feed uploads it here, and a blocked
// device downloads the latest shared payload instead of showing an empty home.
// A scraping SERVER can't do this — the sources reject datacenter IPs (verified:
// public relays get Cloudflare 520/522) — but the crowd's residential IPs can.
//
// The payload is public anime metadata only (titles / hrefs / images) — the
// same data the home screen renders. Writes go through the submit_home_feed
// RPC, which validates the payload shape, restricts item hrefs to the known
// source hosts, and rate-limits each user — a vandal can at worst re-upload a
// valid-looking feed.
//
// All calls are best-effort and fully swallow errors — the cloud cache is a
// fallback, never a dependency. RLS requires an authenticated session (mirrors
// metadataCache), so every call is guarded by a cheap session check.
