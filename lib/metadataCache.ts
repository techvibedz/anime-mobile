// (which bypasses Cloudflare — a datacenter/serverless IP cannot), and on a
// cache miss it uploads the structured result here so the NEXT user of any
// device renders the detail page instantly without paying for a live scrape.
//
// This holds ONLY public anime metadata (title / poster / synopsis / genres /
// episode list with page hrefs). It NEVER holds video stream URLs (.mp4/.m3u8):
// those carry short-lived tokens, expire, and are always resolved live on the
// client at the moment Play is tapped (see resolveVideo in lib/api.ts).
//
// All calls are best-effort and fully swallow errors — the cloud cache is a
// speed-up, never a dependency. RLS requires an authenticated session (mirrors
// episode_queue), so every call is guarded by a cheap session check.
